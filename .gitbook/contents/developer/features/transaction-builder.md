### Add Smart Contract Details
 - Add smart contract address
 - Add smart contract abi
This ensures that Transaction Builder understands the structure and capabilities of your smart contract

### Access Contract Functions
Once the smart contract details are submitted, you gain immediate access to the functions provided by your smart contract interface. These functions are ready for you to use, whether you need to read data from the blockchain or write new information
