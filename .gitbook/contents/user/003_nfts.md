On the [Gateway](https://gateway.boba.network) click on Wallet>NFT and paste in the smart contract address of your NFT as well as the TokenID. Once you have provided the correct values and clicked `Add NFT`, the wallet will find and show your NFT. If it's a Turing Monster, you can autoadd it by clicking `Fetch My Monsters`.
