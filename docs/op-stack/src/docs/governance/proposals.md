## Grant Proposals

::: tip        
             
This information is here for your convenience. 
The source of truth for all governance related processes is the [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#proposal-process--components-of-a-valid-proposal). 
The operating manual is currently in the process of being updated to reflect changes being voted on during Special Voting Cycles. 

:::

Projects may submit a Phase 1 proposal to request OP tokens from the Governance Fund. 
The purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. 
This does not mean that all grants must be incentive programs. 
The Token House is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects. 

However, funding should come with an expectation of growth-related deliverables. 
It is not the intended purpose of the governance fund to retroactively fund public goods without an expectation of future work.
There is a distinct OP allocation dedicated to this, which will be distributed via [the Citizens' House](citizens-house.md) at a later date.


When writing your proposal, please adhere to the [grant proposal template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233).

The process for submitting a grant proposal is currently undergoing changes. 
A Grants Council, which will process grant applications in Season 3 was recently approved. 
Stay tuned for more information on how to submit a proposal to the Council shortly. 
**You can expect grant proposals to begin being processed again via the Grants Council on January 26th.**


## Other proposal types

There are [other types of proposals](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types) that you can submit:

- Protocol Upgrade
- Inflation Adjustment
- Director Removal

There is no minimum holding requirement for submitting a proposal but your proposal must be approved by a delegate with sufficient voting power to move to a vote (as defined in [the operating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types)).

The process for submitting these proposals is very similar to the one for grants.
Where there are differences, they are noted in the table in the operating manual.
