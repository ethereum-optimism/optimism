## Optimism Bug Bounty Program

Optimism takes security seriously and as such, we have a massive bug bounty program. We don't just talk about it either! We have given out one of the [largest bounty payouts ever](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/disclosure-fixing-a-critical-bug-in-optimisms-geth-fork-a836ebdf7c94)! You can read more about that bug [here](https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html). Below are the various bug bounty programs we have, as well as how to reach out to us if your bug is not covered by an existing bounty. 

### Main Bounty Page

Optimism has a very detailed [Bug bounty Page on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/). In the listing you can find all the information relating to assets in scope, reporting, and the payout process. 

### Bedrock Bounty

With our upcoming launch of [Bedrock](../developers/bedrock/how-is-bedrock-different.md) we will be launching a specific bug bounty program. Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/optimismFND) or keep an eye on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/) for more information.

### Unscoped Bug

If you think you have found a critical or major bug that is not covered by our existing bug bounty, please report it to us via the Immunefi program regardless. We will seriously consider the impact of any issues, and have previously rewarded security researchers for bugs not within the stated scope of the program.
