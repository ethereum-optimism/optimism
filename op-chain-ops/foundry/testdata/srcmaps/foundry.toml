# We set the gas limit to max int64 to avoid running out of gas during testing, since the default
# gas limit is 1B and some of our tests require more gas than that, such as `test_callWithMinGas_noLeakageLow_succeeds`.
# We use this gas limit since it was the default gas limit prior to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/8274.
# Due to toml-rs limitations, if you increase the gas limit above this value it must be a string.
