## What is Optimism?

Optimism is a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 blockchain, **but it's also so much more than that**.

Optimism is the technical foundation for [the Optimism Collective](https://app.optimism.io/announcement), a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of **impact=profit** — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.
We're trying to solve some of the most critical coordination failures facing the crypto ecosystem today.
**We're particularly focused on creating a sustainable funding stream for the public goods and infrastructure upon which the ecosystem so heavily relies but has so far been unable to adequately reward.**
We'd love for you to check out [The Optimistic Vision](https://www.optimism.io/vision) to understand more about why we do what we do.

## Documentation

If you want to build on top of Optimism, take a look at the extensive documentation on the [Optimism Community Hub](http://community.optimism.io/).
If you want to build Optimism, check out the [Protocol Specs](./specs/).

## Community

General discussion happens most frequently on the [Optimism discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io).
Governance discussion can also be found on the [Optimism Governance Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/).

## The Bedrock Upgrade

Optimism is currently preparing for [its next major upgrade called Bedrock](https://dev.optimism.io/introducing-optimism-bedrock/).
Bedrock significantly revamps how Optimism works under the hood and will help make Optimism the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable rollup yet.
You can find detailed specifications for the Bedrock upgrade within the [specs folder](./specs) in this repository.

Please note that a significant number of packages and folders within this repository are part of the Bedrock upgrade and are NOT currently running in production.
Refer to the Directory Structure section below to understand which packages are currently running in production and which are intended for use as part of the Bedrock upgrade.

## Branching Model

### Active Branches

| Branch          | Status                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [master](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/)                   | Accepts PRs from `develop` when we intend to deploy to mainnet.                                      |
| [develop](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/)                 | Accepts PRs that are compatible with `master` OR from `release/X.X.X` branches.                    |
| release/X.X.X                                                                          | Accepts PRs for all changes, particularly those not backwards compatible with `develop` and `master`. |

### Overview

We generally follow [this Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Please read the linked post if you're planning to make frequent PRs into this repository (e.g., people working at/with Optimism).

### Production branch

Our production branch is `master`.
The `master` branch contains the code for our latest "stable" releases.
Updates from `master` **always** come from the `develop` branch.
We only ever update the `master` branch when we intend to deploy code within the `develop` to the Optimism mainnet.
Our update process takes the form of a PR merging the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.

### Development branch

Our primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that remains backwards compatible with our latest experimental [network deployments](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/networks/).
If you're making a backwards compatible change, please direct your pull request towards `develop`.

**Changes to contracts within `packages/contracts/contracts` are usually NOT considered backwards compatible and SHOULD be made against a release candidate branch**.
Some exceptions to this rule exist for cases in which we absolutely must deploy some new contract after a release candidate branch has already been fully deployed.
If you're changing or adding a contract and you're unsure about which branch to make a PR into, default to using the latest release candidate branch.
See below for info about release candidate branches.

### Release candidate branches

Branches marked `release/X.X.X` are **release candidate branches**.
Changes that are not backwards compatible and all changes to contracts within `packages/contracts/contracts` MUST be directed towards a release candidate branch.
Release candidates are merged into `develop` and then into `master` once they've been fully deployed.
We may sometimes have more than one active `release/X.X.X` branch if we're in the middle of a deployment.
See table in the **Active Branches** section above to find the right branch to target.

## Releases

### Changesets

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to mark packages for new releases.
When merging commits to the `develop` branch you MUST include a changeset file if your change would require that a new version of a package be released.

To add a changeset, run the command `yarn changeset` in the root of this monorepo.
You will be presented with a small prompt to select the packages to be released, the scope of the release (major, minor, or patch), and the reason for the release.
Comments within changeset files will be automatically included in the changelog of the package.

### Triggering Releases

Releases can be triggered using the following process:

1. Create a PR that merges the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.
2. Wait for the auto-generated `Version Packages` PR to be opened (may take several minutes).
3. Change the base branch of the auto-generated `Version Packages` PR from `master` to `develop` and merge into `develop`.
4. Create a second PR to merge the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.

After merging the second PR into the `master` branch, packages will be automatically released to their respective locations according to the set of changeset files in the `develop` branch at the start of the process.
Please carry this process out exactly as listed to avoid `develop` and `master` falling out of sync.

**NOTE**: PRs containing changeset files merged into `develop` during the release process can cause issues with changesets that can require manual intervention to fix.
It's strongly recommended to avoid merging PRs into develop during an active release.
