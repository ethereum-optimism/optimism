    This is an overview of the changes in [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth),
    a fork of [`go-ethereum`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), part of the OP-stack.

    The OP-stack architecture is modular, following the Consensus/Execution split of post-Merge Ethereum L1:

      - [`op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-node) implements most rollup-specific functionality as Consensus-Layer, similar to a L1 beacon-node. 
      - [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) implements the Execution-Layer, with **minimal changes** for a secure Ethereum-equivalent application environment.

    Related [op-stack specifications](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/specs):

    - [L2 Execution Engine spec](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/exec-engine.md)

              description: |
                The Bedrock upgrade introduces a `Deposit` transaction-type (`0x7E`) to enable both users and the
                rollup system itself to change the L2 state based on L1 events and system rules as
                [specified](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/deposits.md).

              description: |
                The `Transaction` type now exposes the deposit-transaction and L1-cost properties required for the rollup.

              description: |
                Deposit transactions have special processing rules: gas is pre-paid on L1,
                and deposits with EVM-failure are included with rolled back changes (except mint).
                For regular transactions, at the end of the transition, the 1559 burn and L1 cost are routed to vaults.

              description: |
                The gaslimit is free to be set by the Engine API caller, instead of enforcing adjustments of the
                gaslimit in increments of 1/1024 of the previous gaslimit.
                The gaslimit is changed (and limited) through the `SystemConfig` contract.

              description: |
                The Engine API is activated at the Merge transition, with a Total Terminal Difficulty (TTD).
                The rollup starts post-merge, and thus sets the TTD to 0.
                The TTD is always "reached" starting at the bedrock block.

              description: |
                Pre-Bedrock OP-mainnet and OP-Goerli had differently formatted block-headers, loosely compatible with the geth types (since it was based on Clique).
                However, due to differences like the extra-data length (97+ bytes), these legacy block-headers need special verification.
                The pre-merge "consensus" fallback is set to this custom but basic verifier, to accept these headers when syncing a pre-bedrock part of the chain,
                independent of any clique code or configuration (which may be removed from geth at a later point).
                All the custom verifier has to do is accept the headers, as the headers are already verified by block-hash through the reverse-header-sync.

          description: |
            The Engine API is extended to insert transactions into the block and optionally exclude the tx-pool,
            to reproduce the exact block of the sequencer from just the inputs, as derived from L1 by the rollup-node.
