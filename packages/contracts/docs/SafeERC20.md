# SafeERC20



> SafeERC20



*Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful. To use this library you can add a `using SafeERC20 for IERC20;` statement to your contract, which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(...)`, etc.*
