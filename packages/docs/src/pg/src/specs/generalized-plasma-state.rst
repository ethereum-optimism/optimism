=============================
Generalized Plasma State Spec
=============================

- Data Structures
   - ``stateID: uint`` - the index of unique, non-fungible states in a plasma chain
   - ``stateObject`` struct:
      - ``predicate: address`` - the state's predicate ruleset
      - ``parameters: bytes`` - input parameters to the predicate ruleset
   - ``stateUpdate`` struct
      - ``state: state`` - the new state for this range of ``stateID`` s
      - ``start: uint`` - the start of the range of ``stateID`` s
      - ``end: uint`` - the end of the range of ``stateID`` s
      - ``plasmaBlockNumber: uint`` - the plasma block in which a committment was made
   -  ``stateUpdateWitness`` struct
         - ``inclusionProof: bytes[]`` - array of sibling nodes forming the Merkle inclusion proof
   - ``deposit`` struct:
      - ``state: stateObject`` - the initial state of the deposited coin
      - ``start: uint`` - the first ``stateID`` of the deposit. The plasma contract stores a mapping from ``depositEnd->deposit``
      - ``precedingPlasmaBlockNumber: uint`` - the most recent plasma block leading up to the deposit.
   - ``exitableRange`` struct:
         - ``start: uint`` - The first ``stateID`` of a still-exitable range. The plasma contract stores a mapping from ``cexitableRangeEnd->exitableableRange``
         - ``isSet: bool`` - whether or not this value in the mapping has been initialized. Needed because EVM can't differentiate between a mapping set to 0 and an unset mapping.
     - ``exit`` struct:
         - ``update: stateUpdate`` - the state being claimed.
         - ``exitStart`` - the start of the update's subrange claiming to be undeprecated.
         - ``exitEnd`` - the end of the update's subrange claiming to be undeprecated.
         - ``ethBlockRedeemable: uint`` - when the ``exit``'s dispute period expires.
         - ``numChallenges: uint`` - the number of pending challenges preventing a ``exit``'s redemption.
     - ``challenge`` struct:
         - ``earlierExitID: uint`` - the earlier undeprecated ``exit`` being used to challenge an invlaid ``exit``.
         - ``laterExitID: uint`` - the challenged ``exit``.
- Commitment Contract
    - Public Variables:
        - ``operator: public(address)`` - the operator's address.
        - ``nextPlasmaBlockNumber: public(uint256)`` - what the block number of the next block committment will be.
        - ``lastPublish: public(uint256)`` - the Ethereum block number of the last plasma block.
        - ``blockHashes: public(map(uint256, bytes32))`` - the blocks submitted so far.
    - Methods:
        - ``setup`` - Used to initiate the contract with collator pubkey
        - ``commitBlock``: allows the operator to submit sequential blocks
        - ``verifyUpdate(update: stateUpdate, subject: address, stateUpdateWitness: bytes)``: returns bool whether a given ``commitment`` was made on behalf of a given ``subject`` address (this is the plasma contract for e.g. a specific ERC20), at a the given ``plasmaBlockNumber``, based on a valid ``commitmentWitness``
    - Block Structure/Proof Validity, as checked by ``verifyUpdate``:
        - merkle node format: ``[hash: bytes32][subject: address][index: bytes16]``
        - merkle parent function: ``parent(leftSibling, rightSibling) = [sha256([leftSibling][rightSibling])][rightSibling.subject][rightSibling.index]``
        - merkle proof format: ``siblingMerkleNodes[]`` - array of the siblings going up the branch
        - branch validity requires that left ``siblingMerkleNodes`` going up the branch are monotonically decreasin
        - For a given ``commitment``, ``subject``, and ``commitmentWitness``, where the ``leaf`` is the bottommost node in the ``stateUpdateWitness`` we must have:
            - ``leaf.subject == subject``
            - ``stateUpdate.end <= leaf.index``
            - ``stateUpdate.subject = leaf.subject``
            - ``stateUpdate.start >= START`` where ``START`` is either the merkle proof's deepest left sibling, or ``0`` if none exist (this is only the case for the ``0``th element in the tree)
        - leaf nodes are parsed to ``[hash(state)][subject][state.end]``
            - NOTE: for any nodes in the tree whose sibling has the same ``subject`` address, we may remove the address for efficiency, as long as the above conditions are met as if the ``subject`` is prepended to the index.  This is definitely an optimization to consider down the line!

- Plasma Contract
     - Public Variables:
         - ``self.commitmentAddress`` - where the operator is submitting commitments
         - ``self.tokenAddress`` - the ERC20 contract of for this plasma contract (we'll have one contract per token)
         - ``self.deposits[end: uint] -> deposit`` - mapping of all deposits to ``deposit`` structs
         - ``self.exitableRanges[end: uint] -> exitableRange`` - mapping of all the unclaimed ranges ("states still in the plasma chain")
         - ``self.exits[exitID] -> exit`` - all of the current exits
         - ``self.challenges[challengeID] -> challenge`` - all of the current challenges on exits
         - ``self.DISPUTE_PERIOD: uint`` - the minimum dispute period before a claim can be redeemed
     - Public methods:
         - ``deposit(amount, state)``
             - Deposits specifiy an initial state and the amount of money being deposited into that state
             - adds to ``self.deposits``
             - extends ``self.claimableRanges`` so that the state is now claimable
         - ``exitStateUpdate(exitStart: uint, exitEnd: uint, update: stateUpdate, updateWitness: stateUpdateWitness, initiationWitness: bytes)`` - allows users to submit a claim on a committed state
             - ``assert verifyUpdate(update, self.address, stateUpdateWitness)``
             - assert ``exitStart >= update.start``
             - assert ``exitEnd <= update.end ``
             - ``assert update.state.predicate.can_initiate_exit(update, initiationWitness)``
             - if so, adds a new exit to ``self.exits``
             - sets the exit's ``ethBlockRedeemable`` to: ``eth.block + self.CHALLENGE_PERIOD + state.predicateAddress.getAdditionalLockup(update)``
         - ``exitDeposit(exitStart: uint, exitEnd: uint, depositEnd: uint, claimabilityWitness:bytes)`` - allows users to submit an exit on a deposited state
             - both of the above store an ``exit`` struct in ``self.exits[self.exitNonce]`` and increment ``self.exitNonce``.
             - sets the claim's ``ethBlockRedeemable`` to: ``eth.block + self.CHALLENGE_PERIOD + state.predicateAddress.getAdditionalLockup(state)``
             - In this case, the ``update.plasmaBlockNumber`` comes from the ``deposit.precedingPlasmaBlockNumber``
         - ``challengeExit(earlierExitID, laterExitID)`` - allows users to challenge a later exit with an earlier undeprecated exit
             - this is the way we challenge exits if the operator commits some a state with something undprecated in the history. The function checks that:
                 - ``earlierExitID``'s claimed range intersects that of ``laterExitID``
                 - ``earlierExitID.update.plasmaBlockNumber < laterExitID.update.plasmaBlockNumber``
                 - ``eth.block < laterExit.ethBlockRedeemable``
             - if so, it does the following:
                 - create a ``challenge`` object in ``self.challenges[challengeNonce]``
                 - increment ``challengeNonce``
                 - increase the ``laterExit.ethBlockRedeemable`` to ``earlierExit.ethBlockRedeemable`` if the latter is bigger
                 - increment ``challengedClaim.numChallenges``
         - ``cancelDeprecatedExit(stateID: uint, exitID: uint, deprecationWitness: bytes)`` - allows users to cancel an exit by demonstrating a ``deprecationWitness`` for one of the ``state``s in its range
             - ``exit = self.exits[exitID]``
             - ``assert exit.update.predicateAddress.verifyDeprecation(stateID, exit.update, deprecationWitness)``
             - if so, clears the exit, deleting it from the ``self.exits`` mapping
         - ``removeChallenge(challengeID: uint)`` - allows users to remove a challenge 
             - checks that the ``self.challenges[challengeID].earlierExit`` has been revoked, i.e. that its key is no longer set to a value in self.exits[]
             - if so, decrements the ``self.exits[self.challenges[challengeID].laterExitID].numChallenges`` and then clears/deletes ``self.challenges[challengeID]``
         - ``finalizeExit(exitID, exitableRangeEnds)``
             - asserts ``exit``'s numChallenges = 0
             - tries ``isRangeClaimable`` for the various ``claimableRangeEnds``, reverts if none pass the check
             - asserts the current ``eth.block >= exit.ethBlockRedeemable``
             - approves the ERC20 claim amount (``=start-end``) to be transferred by the ``exit.update.state.predicateAddress``
             - calls ``finalizeExit(update)`` on the ``update.state.predicateAddress``

- Predicate interface
     - Public methods/interface:
         - ``verifyDeprecation(stateID: uint, update: stateUpdate, deprecationWitness: bytes) -> bool`` - returns true/false whether a given ``deprecationWitness`` is valid (if true the exit may be cancelled)
         - ``finalizeExit(update: stateUpdate)`` - called once a claim on a state is redeemed on the plasma contract
             - in principle, this can do anything, but will almost always call the ``ERC20.transferFrom`` function to the tune of ``exit.start - exit.end``, either to itself to initiate an additional dispute period, or to some ultimate beneficiary as devised from the ``exit.update.state.parameters``
         - ``canInitiateExit(update: stateUpdate, initiationWitness: bytes) -> bool`` - returns true/false whether a claimant is eligible to submit an exit on a given state
         - ``getAdditionalDisputePeriod(update: stateUpdate)`` - returns an additional number of ETH blocks which must elapse, in addition to the standard ``plasmaContract.DISPUTE_PERIOD``, before the exit may be redeemed
