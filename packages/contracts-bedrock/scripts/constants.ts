/**
 * Predeploys are Solidity contracts that are injected into the initial L2 state and provide
 * various useful functions.
 * Notes:
 * 0x42...04 was the address of the OVM_ProxySequencerEntrypoint. This contract is no longer in
 * use and has therefore been removed. We may place a new predeployed contract at this address
 * in the future. See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/549 for more info.
