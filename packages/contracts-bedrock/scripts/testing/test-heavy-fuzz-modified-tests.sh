# This script is used to run extra fuzz test iterations on any fuzz tests that
# have been added or modified in a PR. We typically want to run extra fuzz
# iterations when new tests are added to make sure that they are not flaky with
# some small percentage of fuzz runs.
# NOTE: This script is NOT perfect and can only catch changes to fuzz tests
# that are made within the test file itself. It won't catch changes to
# dependencies or other external factors that might impact the behavior of the
# fuzz test. This script may also run fuzz tests that have not actually been
# modified.

# Set the number of fuzz runs to run.
# 75000 fuzz runs will guarantee that any test that fails 5% of the time with
# the default 512 fuzz runs will fail >99.9% of the time (on average) inside of
# this script.
