# @eth-optimism/devnet-tasks

`@eth-optimism/devnet-tasks` is a temporary package that hosts two [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) tasks used within the [`bedrock-devnet`](/bedrock-devnet/README.md) and is not meant to be published to NPM.
You can generally disregard this package unless you are working on the `bedrock-devnet`.
