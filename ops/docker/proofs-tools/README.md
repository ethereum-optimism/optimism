## Proofs Tools

The proofs-tools docker image provides a collection of useful fault proofs related tools in a single docker image.
In particular it provides op-challenger with cannon, asterisc, op-program and kona-host ready to participate in
cannon, asterisc or asterisc-kona game types.

The version of each tool used in the image is specified
in [docker-bake.hcl](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/docker-bake.hcl).
